# Next.js Runtime Error After Hot Reload with Navigation

This repository demonstrates a runtime error in a Next.js application that occurs after a hot reload when navigating between pages using `next/link` and the `useRouter` hook. The error only manifests after a hot reload and not on initial page load. 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about` using the link on the home page.
5. Navigate to `/contact` using the button on the `/about` page.
6. Perform a hot reload (e.g., by modifying a file and saving it).
7. Attempt to navigate between pages again.

## Expected Behavior

Navigation between pages should work seamlessly even after a hot reload. 

## Actual Behavior

After a hot reload, navigation often results in a runtime error, indicating a problem with client-side routing or the interaction between `next/link` and `useRouter`.

## Solution

The solution involves restructuring the navigation to ensure proper handling of client-side transitions after a hot reload. Further investigation may be needed to pinpoint the exact root cause of the issue.  The updated code is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
